## Meme - generator

This is a simple React application that generates a random meme image with top and bottom text. The application consists of three components:

* ### App:
     The main component that renders the Header and Meme components.
* ### Header: 
     A header component that displays the title and project information.
* ### Meme:
     A component that generates a random meme image and allows the user to enter top and bottom text.
     Here we are using Event Listeners(onClick) , State, Forms, Side effects(useEffect) to fetch API.
